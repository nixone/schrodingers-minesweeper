# Schr√∂dinger's Minesweeper

Just a little project for fun, remake of the traditional Minesweeper game with a little tweak: Mines that disappear :)

## Requirements

To play this game, you must have Java 6 SE or higher installed and available by command line (you should check this only if you have java installed and the game won't even start).

## How to play

Download (or clone the repository), go to /dist folder and run the run_xyz script (depending on your operating system).

Enjoy :)
